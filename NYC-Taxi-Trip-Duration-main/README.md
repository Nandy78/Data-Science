# NYC Taxi Trip Duration


In this competition, Kaggle is challenging contestants to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. Primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.

Longtime Kagglers will recognize that this competition objective is similar to the ECML/PKDD trip time challenge we hosted in 2015. But, this challenge comes with a twist. Instead of awarding prizes to the top finishers on the leaderboard, this playground competition was created to reward collaboration and collective learning.
